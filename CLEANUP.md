# Repository Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the repository to remove unnecessary files and streamline the development workflow.

## 🗑️ Files Removed

### Duplicate/Outdated Configurations
- **`.releaserc.alternative.json`** - Duplicate semantic-release configuration that wasn't being used
- **`RELEASE.md`** - Outdated documentation for the old multi-branch release strategy

### Unnecessary Scripts  
- **`scripts/reset-semantic-release.sh`** - One-time setup script no longer needed

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Semantic Release Configuration
- **`.releaserc.json`**
  - Removed `@semantic-release/exec` plugin 
  - Simplified asset tracking (removed README.md from auto-commit)
  - Kept the essential plugins: commit-analyzer, release-notes-generator, changelog, git, github

### Scripts Updated
- **`scripts/update-readme-version.sh`**
  - Improved cross-platform compatibility (macOS/Linux sed)
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Added usage instructions
  - Now runs manually instead of automatically

- **`scripts/setup-simplified-workflow.sh`**
  - Removed references to old `V*.*.*` branch patterns
  - Updated cleanup instructions for current workflow

### Dependencies
- **`package.json`** - Removed `@semantic-release/exec` dependency

## 📁 Current File Structure

### Scripts (4 files)
```
scripts/
├── commit.sh              # ✅ Helper for conventional commits
├── promote-release.sh     # ✅ Essential for dev→main promotion  
├── setup-simplified-workflow.sh # ✅ Initial setup helper
└── update-readme-version.sh # ✅ Manual version update utility
```

### GitHub Actions (3 workflows)
```
.github/workflows/
├── auto-release-pr.yml    # ✅ Handles promotion from dev to main
├── pr-validation.yml      # ✅ Validates pull requests
└── release.yml           # ✅ Creates releases on both branches
```

### Configuration Files
```
├── .releaserc.json       # ✅ Simplified semantic-release config
├── commitlint.config.js  # ✅ Commit message validation
└── .husky/               # ✅ Git hooks for quality checks
    ├── commit-msg        # Validates commit messages
    ├── pre-commit        # Type checking and linting
    └── pre-push          # Build verification
```

## 🎯 Current Workflow Summary

1. **Development**: Work on `dev` branch, get automatic pre-releases
2. **Quality Gates**: Husky hooks ensure code quality
3. **Promotion**: Use `[promote]` tag or manual workflow to create stable releases
4. **Documentation**: Manual README version updates when needed

## 🧹 Manual Cleanup Recommendations

Run these commands if you want to clean up any remaining old branches:

```bash
# Check for old branches
git branch -a

# Remove old branches locally (if they exist)
git branch -D canary  # If it exists
git branch -D any-old-feature-branches

# Remove old branches remotely (if they exist) 
git push origin --delete canary  # If it exists
```

## 📊 Benefits of Cleanup

- ✨ **Simplified**: Removed duplicate and unused configurations
- 🔧 **Maintainable**: Clear distinction between active and removed files  
- 📝 **Documented**: Clear workflow with focused tools
- 🚀 **Streamlined**: Faster CI/CD with fewer moving parts
- 💾 **Lightweight**: Smaller repository size without unused dependencies
