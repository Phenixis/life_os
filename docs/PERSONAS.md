# Personas

## Persona 1: Alex, College Student

Alex is a 20-year-old junior at a state university juggling coursework, a part-time internship, and a budding side hustle. He’s driven by big goals but struggles to keep his tasks and ideas organized. He’s tried generic to-do apps and paper planners but finds them either too rigid or too cluttered.

### Problems
Alex feels overwhelmed by competing priorities and loose ends.

Deadlines, meeting notes, and creative ideas live in scattered apps or notebooks. He wastes time hunting for information and often misses simple tasks.

He becomes frustrated, anxious about falling behind, and worries his ambition is hamstrung by disorganization.


### Pains
- Missed deadlines leading to lower grades and praise from supervisors.
- Mental fatigue from context-switching between apps and notebooks.
- Frequent lost ideas that undermine his creative side hustle.
- Stress and guilt for forgetting small but important tasks.
- Imposter syndrome fueled by a sense of chaos in his daily life.

### Goals
Alex wants a unified system that gives him clarity and focus in every domain of his life. Rationally, he needs to track coursework, internship deliverables, and side-project milestones in one place. Emotionally, he craves the confidence and calm that come from knowing nothing slips through the cracks. With a tailored ‘operating system,’ he can channel his ambition into consistent progress and feel in control of his future.

### Benefits craved
- Clear mental space to focus on creative work and deep study.
- Consistent progress on side projects without sacrificing grades.
- Reduced anxiety by having a single source of truth for tasks.
- Boosted confidence as he checks off well-structured goals.
- Improved reputation among professors and mentors for reliability.

### Status-quo solution
Right now Alex uses a mix of Google Keep for quick notes, Trello for project boards, and paper notebooks for random sketches. He toggles between these tools daily, which fragments his attention. When too busy, he simply abandons planning and works reactively, trusting his memory and sticky notes. This patchwork approach feels familiar but stressful.

### Context about others solutions
- Knows about Notion’s flexibility but fears building his own templates is tedious.
- Has tried Todoist but found its lists too linear for creative workflows.
- Heard about Bullet Journal but dislikes analog planners’ lack of search.
- Sees Roam Research buzz but worries about paying high subscription fees.
- Aware of ClickUp but concerned it’s built for teams, not individuals.

### Event triggering
After missing a key client call for his graphic design side hustle, Alex realized his scattered notes cost him a $200 project. At the same time, he got a warning from his internship supervisor about incomplete deliverables. That double-hit made him decide it’s time to overhaul his workflow. He’s now actively looking for a system that aligns with his high-energy, multi-project lifestyle.


### Doubts that slow down
- Skepticism: ‘Another productivity app? Will it actually help?’
- Time investment: Fear of spending hours configuring a new tool.
- Feature overload: Worried the system will feel too complex.
- Cost sensitivity: College budget limits his willingness to pay.
- Habits: Comfortable with his existing scattered but familiar workflow.

### Sales cycle
Alex’s purchase cycle is episodic. He typically researches tools whenever midterms or project deadlines spike stress. Each search spans 2–3 weeks of reading reviews, watching tutorials, and trialing free plans. He’s most receptive at the start of a semester or before a major side-hustle launch. Marketing touchpoints should align with academic calendar events and internship recruiting seasons.
