title: What subject should I focus on when making software?

summary: I’m a software developer, I build software around my interests. I’m not the most skilled software developer, so if I’m building an application for development, it might not be as polished as what others are creating. So, what subject should I focus on when making software?

I’m a software developer, and like many of my peers, I build software around my interests. I had a problem with managing my shopping lists, so I built [wisecart.app](https://www.wisecart.app). I also develop applications with the same foundation, so I built [my boilerplate](https://boilerplate.maximeduhamel.com). Since the beginning of 2025, I’ve been posting videos on YouTube. As I move toward making more scripted videos, I needed a tool to improve my scripts, so my next startup focuses on that. However, I’m facing a challenge. I’m not the most skilled software developer, so if I’m building an application for development, it might not be as polished as what others are creating. So, what subject should I focus on when making software?
