Give me a developper that want to build an authority around his work but doesn't have a portfolio.
I think there is none, for a good reason: a portfolio shows your work, your skills, and your personnality. It helps you get a job or convert visitors into client, and make friends generally for free.

Now, the fact that every developpers has a portfolio implies a high competition. If you want your portfolio to be a competitive advantage, you have to <a href="#the-actual-state-of-portfolios">take a look at the current state of portfolios</a>, then <a href="#why-an-early-developper-should-have-one">determine if you should build your own</a> and finally <a href="#how-to-stand-out-of-the-crowd">learn how to make one better than the others</a> 

# The actual state of portfolios

The other day, a friend of mine showed me a <a href="https://rogierdeboeve.com/" target="_blank">beautiful portfolio of a developper</a>. When I saw it, I was amazed : The UX was impressive and the style was beautiful ! This guy prooved by his portfolio that he knows how to design beautiful pages and will make an excellent work for your company for sure. And that's the most important, right ?

Here is the problem: a portfolio should <span className="italic">obviously</span> link to your project, but it shouldn't <span className="italic">obviously</span> have an impressive UX or a beautiful style. Your portfolio shouldn't prove your skills by its form: your projects already do the job. A portfolio should showcase your personality, your style, your thoughts. Because a customer/recruiter doesn't only choose a skill-set, but a human and it's a loss not to show your personality. You're only giving half of what the recruiter/customer is looking for.
